# Use Case 10: Booking Cancellation & Inventory Rollback
Goal: Enable safe cancellation of confirmed bookings by correctly reversing system state changes, ensuring inventory consistency and predictable recovery behavior.

Actor:

Guest – initiates a cancellation request for an existing booking.
Cancellation Service – validates cancellations and performs controlled rollback operations.
Flow:

Guest initiates a cancellation request.
The system validates the reservation to ensure it exists and is cancellable.
The allocated room ID is recorded in a rollback structure.
Inventory count for the corresponding room type is incremented.
Booking history is updated to reflect the cancellation.
System state is restored consistently.
Key Concepts Used
State Reversal - Cancellation requires undoing previously completed operations. The system must revert inventory and booking state without introducing inconsistencies.
Stack Data Structure - A Stack<String> is used to track recently released room IDs. Stacks follow a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, which naturally models rollback behavior.
LIFO Rollback Logic - The most recent allocation is the first to be reversed. This aligns with real-world undo operations and simplifies recovery logic.
Controlled Mutation - State changes during cancellation are performed in a strict, predefined order. This prevents partial rollbacks and protects system integrity.
Inventory Restoration - Inventory counts are incremented immediately after cancellation. This ensures availability accurately reflects the current system state.
Validation of Cancellation Requests - The system verifies that a reservation exists before allowing cancellation. Invalid or duplicate cancellation attempts are rejected safely.
Key Requirements
Allow cancellation of confirmed bookings only.
Validate reservation existence before performing rollback.
Release allocated room IDs back to the availability pool.
Restore inventory counts accurately and immediately.
Prevent cancellation of non-existent or already cancelled bookings.
Key Benefits
Safe recovery of inventory after cancellations
Consistent system state across the booking lifecycle
Controlled and predictable rollback behavior
Drawbacks of Previous Use Case
Use Case 9 focused on input validation but did not address reversing valid operations.
Without rollback support, confirmed bookings could not be safely undone.
