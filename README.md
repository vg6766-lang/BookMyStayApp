#Use Case 7: Add-On Service Selection
Goal: Extend the booking model to support optional services, demonstrating how real-world business features can be added without modifying core booking or allocation logic.

Actor:

Guest – selects optional services for an existing reservation.
Add-On Service – represents an individual optional offering.
Add-On Service Manager – manages the association between reservations and selected services.
Flow:

Guest selects one or more add-on services.
Selected services are added to a list.
The list of services is mapped to the corresponding reservation ID.
Additional cost for the reservation is calculated.
Core booking and inventory state remain unchanged.
Key Concepts Used
Business Extensibility - Real-world bookings often include additional offerings beyond the primary product. The system must support new features without disrupting existing logic.
One-to-Many Relationship - A single reservation can have multiple associated services. This relationship is modeled using a map from reservation ID to a list of services.
Map and List Combination - Map<String, List<Service>> allows efficient lookup of services for a reservation. Lists preserve insertion order and allow multiple services to be attached.
Composition over Inheritance - Services are composed with reservations rather than inherited. This avoids rigid class hierarchies and supports flexible feature growth.
Separation of Core and Optional Features - Add-on services are managed independently of room allocation and inventory. This prevents optional features from complicating critical booking workflows.
Cost Aggregation - Service costs are calculated separately and combined when needed. This keeps pricing logic modular and easier to extend.
Key Requirements
Allow multiple services to be attached to a single reservation.
Store selected services using a reservation-to-services mapping.
Calculate total additional cost for selected services.
Ensure add-on logic does not modify booking or inventory state.
Support easy addition of new service types.
Key Benefits
Flexible attachment of optional services to reservations
Clean mapping between bookings and value-added features
Easy expansion of services without core booking changes
Drawbacks of Previous Use Case
Use Case 6 confirmed room allocation but treated bookings as static entities.
Without add-on support, the system could not model common real-world booking enhancements.
