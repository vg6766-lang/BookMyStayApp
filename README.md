# Use Case 5: Booking Request (First-Come-First-Served)
Goal: Handle multiple booking requests fairly by introducing a request intake mechanism that preserves arrival order, reflecting real-world booking behavior during peak demand.

Actor:

Reservation – represents a guest’s intent to book a room.
Booking Request Queue – manages and orders incoming booking requests.
Flow:

Guest submits a booking request.
The request is added to the booking queue.
Requests are stored in arrival order.
Queued requests wait for processing by the allocation system.
No inventory mutation occurs at this stage.
Key Concepts Used
Problem of Simultaneous Requests - During peak demand, multiple booking requests can arrive at nearly the same time. Without ordering, requests may be processed inconsistently, leading to unfair allocation.
Queue Data Structure - A Queue<Reservation> is used to store booking requests.
Queues naturally model waiting lines where elements are processed in sequence.
FIFO Principle - FIFO (First-Come-First-Served) ensures that the earliest request is processed first. This mirrors fairness expectations in real booking systems.
Fairness - Using a queue guarantees that no request can bypass another. All guests are treated equally based on request arrival time.
Request Ordering - The queue preserves insertion order automatically. This eliminates the need for manual sorting or timestamp comparison.
Decoupling Request Intake from Allocation - Requests are collected first and processed later. This separation prepares the system for controlled allocation and concurrency handling.
Key Requirements
Accept booking requests from guests.
Store requests in a queue structure.
Preserve the order in which requests arrive.
Ensure no room allocation or inventory updates occur at this stage.
Prepare requests for subsequent processing.
Key Benefits
Fair and deterministic booking request handling
Predictable system behavior under peak load
Simplified request coordination before allocation
Drawbacks of Previous Use Case
Use Case 4 allowed room visibility but did not handle booking intent.
Without a request intake mechanism, simultaneous booking attempts could not be managed fairly.
